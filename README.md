# React Companion AI

This app utilizes a GPT model to generate interactive stories and characters with whom users can interact via chat. Users have the capability to create characters, after which the AI generates narratives based on these characters. Interaction with the characters is facilitated through a chat interface, enabling users to engage with the AI-driven stories.

The app is powered by a backend system developed using Laravel and operates through a REST API. The backend has not been released for public use.
